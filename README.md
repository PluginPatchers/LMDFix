# ARCHIVED
LMD has fixed the issues on their own mod, so this mod is no longer needed.

# LMDFix

Adding onto the optimization that LMD already does, LMDFix also checks if the mob is flagged as "Important." For example, if the mob is marked as persistent with the use of commands, then it will not despawn. LMDFix also fixes the bug where some mobs are falsely being despawned even if they are wearing a nametag.
--------------------------------------------------
# LMD

When a mob is given an item and the mob equips or picks it up it becomes persistent in the world and will not despawn naturally. One of the largest contributor to entity lag in minecraft are persistent mobs, and modded makes it worse by adding and spawning more mobs.

LMD tweaks the despawn check to allow mobs that pick up or equip items from the ground to naturally despawn like any other mob. Any picked up or equipped item is dropped back on the ground when the entity despawns to make sure you don't lose your items incase the mob picks them up after your death.

You can still prevent mobs from naturally despawning by naming them with a name tag.
